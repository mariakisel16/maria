      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie pastry inspired by
      the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
      laminated dough.
      <br />
      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
      crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. Kipferls have long been a
      staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern
      croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers
      replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated
      dough. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen,
      preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be
      freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La
      Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food,
      and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and
      patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
